# Rcpuid

[libcpuid](http://libcpuid.sourceforge.net/)
is a cross-platform C library for x86 CPU detection.
The [Rcpuid](https://github.com/wrathematics/Rcpuid)
package is a set of R bindings (and a few minor 
improvements) for cpuid.  Along with some helper utilities, the 
package offers three main functions:  `cpu_clock()`, `cpu_id()`,
and `cpu_ins()`.



## CPU Clock

The return is a list containing the total number
of cores detected on the system (note: only cores available on the
calling node are detected), the CPU clock in MHz as reported by the
operating system (more on this later), the CPU clock in MHz as 
detected by a simple test, and the estimated peak FLOPS.

```{r}
library(Rcpuid)

cpu_clock()
```

Why the two reports of CPU clock, you may be wondering.  The reason 
is, all modern operating systems downscale CPU clocks when they're
not very busy, and upscale when there's work to do.  Ostensibly this
is a power/energy-saving feature; in reality, these features
tend to not work very well.  Generally you can expect your system to 
underperform for almost no energy savings...but it makes people
feel good, so here we are.

So you will probably see a huge discrepancy between the value
reported by the OS and the value reported by the test.  For example, 
when using the "ondemand" CPU governor (Linux), my OS reports that
my clock is 830 MHz.  But when I set the governor to performance,
the OS reports 2159 MHz, which isn't too far from the tested value
of 2166 MHz.

It's worth noting that given how the modern CPU works, this value
is mostly (but not entirely) worthless; the above is just one
demonstration.



## CPU Identification

Rcpuid can also identify your CPU vendor, possibly your CPU codename, 
and probably your CPU brand name:

```{r}
library(Rcpuid)

cpu_id()
```



## CPU Instruction Sets

Finally, we can easily see which instruction sets are available for
your given architecture:

```{r}
library(Rcpuid)

cpu_ins()
```
